BEFORE YOU START ANYTHING
run 'npm install' to install all the node modules you're needing

follow the instructions at https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/create-react-app to install tailwind 

Importantly, make sure your styling responsively mobile first, so make sure you style it in a way that is good for mobile devices first and then use the sm: breakpoint to then change it for bigger screens (sm: stylings unintuitively apply to screens bigger than the sm size)

please conserve the color and sizing schemes (if possible, only use sizes and colors that have already been used)
If you have any questions whatsoever or suggestions then msg me
